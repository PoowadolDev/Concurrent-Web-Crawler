# Concurrent-Web-Crawler
I'm undertaking this project to deepen my understanding of Go's concurrency features, especially Goroutines. By building a concurrent web crawler, I'll gain practical experience with Goroutines, channels, and synchronization tools like mutexes and wait groups. This will help me write more efficient and scalable Go code.
